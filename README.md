# Hangman_game
This code is about an amazing game. Imagine a secret word with hidden letters. You have to guess the word by suggesting letters one by one. If you guess correctly, you'll see more of the word. But if you make a mistake, the hangman gets closer to being complete! You have to guess the word before the hangman is finished. It's a fun and exciting game.
